/**
@brief Base for glyph caches
@m_since{2019,10}

A GPU-API-agnostic base for glyph caches, supporting multiple fonts and both 2D
and 2D array textures. Provides a common interface for adding fonts, glyph
properties, uploading glyph data and retrieving glyph properties back, the
@ref GlyphCacheGL, @ref GlyphCacheArrayGL and @ref DistanceFieldGlyphCacheGL
subclasses then provide concrete implementations backed with an OpenGL texture.

@section Text-AbstractGlyphCache-usage Basic usage

A glyph cache is constructed through the concrete GPU-API-specific subclasses,
such as @ref GlyphCacheGL. Its constructor takes a @ref PixelFormat and desired
texture size. @ref PixelFormat::R8Unorm is the usual choice,
@ref PixelFormat::RGBA8Unorm is useful for emoji fonts or when arbitrary icon
data are put into the cache.

@snippet Text-gl.cpp AbstractGlyphCache-usage-construct

Afterwards, assuming there's an opened @ref AbstractFont instance and a known
set of glyphs to prerender, the high-level use involves just calling
@ref AbstractFont::fillGlyphCache(), which then does all packing and data
copying on its own. Note that depending on the font file, font plugin
implementation, font size and cache size, it may happen that the characters
won't all fit, which should be checked by the application:

@snippet Text.cpp AbstractGlyphCache-usage-fill

As long as the cache size allows, you can call
@ref AbstractFont::fillGlyphCache() multiple times with additional glyphs and
other fonts. See the @ref Text-AbstractFont-glyph-cache "AbstractFont documentation"
for more options for glyph cache filling. Finally, assuming a @ref RendererGL
is used with this cache for rendering the text, its
@relativeref{RendererGL,mesh()} can be then drawn using @ref Shaders::VectorGL,
together with binding @ref GlyphCacheGL::texture() for drawing:

@snippet Text-gl.cpp AbstractGlyphCache-usage-draw

@section Text-AbstractGlyphCache-filling Filling the glyph cache directly

This section describes low level usage of the glyph cache filling APIs, which
are useful mainly when implementing an @ref AbstractFont itself or when adding
arbitrary other image data to the cache. Let's say we want to fill the glyph
cache with a custom set of images that don't necessarily need to be a font per
se. Assuming the input images are stored in a simple array, and the goal is to
put them all together into the cache and reference them later simply by their
array indices.

@snippet Text.cpp AbstractGlyphCache-filling-images

@subsection Text-AbstractGlyphCache-filling-font Adding a font

As the cache supports multiple fonts, each glyph added to it needs to be
associated with a particular font. The @ref addFont() function takes an upper
bound on *glyph IDs* used in the font and optionally an identifier to associate
it with a concrete @ref AbstractFont instance to look it up later with
@ref findFont(). It returns a *font ID* that's subsequently used for adding and
querying glyphs. In our case the glyph IDs are simply indices into the array,
so the upper bound is the array size:

@snippet Text.cpp AbstractGlyphCache-filling-font

@subsection Text-AbstractGlyphCache-filling-atlas Reserving space in the glyph atlas

Each glyph cache contains an instance of @ref TextureTools::AtlasLandfill
packer, which is used to layout glyph data into the cache texture as well as
maintain the remaining free space when more glyphs get added. In this case
we'll ask it for best offsets corresponding to the input image sizes, and as we
created the cache as 2D, we can get 2D offsets back. To keep the example
simple, rotations are disabled as well, see the atlas packer class docs for
information about how to deal with them and achieve potentially better packing
efficiency.

@snippet Text.cpp AbstractGlyphCache-filling-atlas

On success, @ref TextureTools::AtlasLandfill::add() returns a range spanning
all added images, which we'll use later for GPU texture upload. In case of a
failure, triggering the assertion above, the cache size was picked too small or
there was already enough glyphs added that the new ones didn't fit. The
solution is then to either increase the cache size, turn the cache into an
array, or create a second cache for the new data. Depending on the input sizes
it's also possible to achieve a better packing efficiency by toggling various
@ref TextureTools::AtlasLandfillFlag values --- you can for example create
temporary instances aside, attempt packing with them, and then for filling the
glyph cache itself pick the set of flags that resulted in the smallest
@ref TextureTools::AtlasLandfill::filledSize().

@subsection Text-AbstractGlyphCache-filling-glyphs Adding glyphs

With the `offsets` array filled, everything is ready for adding images into the
cache with @ref addGlyph() and copying their data to respective locations
in the cache @ref image(). Together with input image sizes, the `offsets` are
used to form @relativeref{Magnum,Range2Di} instances. What is left at zeros in
this case is the third *glyph offset* argument, which describes how the glyph
image is positioned relative to the text layouting cursor (used for example for
letters *j* or *q* that reach below the baseline).

@snippet Text.cpp AbstractGlyphCache-filling-glyphs

Important is to call @ref flushImage() at the end, which makes the glyph cache
update its actual GPU-side texture based on what area of the image was updated.
In case of @ref DistanceFieldGlyphCacheGL for example it also triggers distance
field generation for given area.

If the images put into the cache are meant to be used with general meshes, the
@ref TextureTools::atlasTextureCoordinateTransformation() function can be used
to create an appropriate texture coordinate transformation matrix. See its
documentation for an example of calculating and applying the matrix to either
the mesh directly or to a material / shader.

@subsection Text-AbstractGlyphCache-filling-incremental Incremental population

As long as the cache size allows, it's possible to add more fonts with
additional glyphs. It's also possible to call @ref addGlyph() for any font that
was added previously, as long as the added glyph ID is within corresponding
@ref fontGlyphCount() bounds and given glyph ID wasn't added yet. That allows
for example a use case where the glyph cache is initially empty and glyphs are
rasterized to it only as needed by actually rendered text, which is especially
useful with large alphabets or when the set of used fonts is large.

However, note that packing the atlas with all glyphs from all fonts just once
will always result in a more optimal layout of the glyph data than adding the
glyphs incrementally.

@subsection Text-AbstractGlyphCache-filling-invalid-glyph Setting a custom invalid glyph

By default, to denote an invalid glyph, i.e. a glyph that isn't present in the
cache, a zero-area rectangle is used. This can be overriden with
@ref setInvalidGlyph(). Its usage is similar to @ref addGlyph(), in particular
you may want to reserve its space together with other glyphs to achieve best
packing.

Additionally, glyph ID @cpp 0 @ce in fonts is usually reserved for invalid
font-specific glyphs as well. The cache-global invalid glyph can thus be either
a special one or you can make it alias some other font-specific invalid glyph,
by calling @ref setInvalidGlyph() with the same arguments as @ref addGlyph()
for a font-specific glyph ID @cpp 0 @ce.

@section Text-AbstractGlyphCache-querying Querying glyph properties and glyph data

A glyph cache can be queried for ID of a particular font with @ref findFont(),
passing the @ref AbstractFont pointer to it. If no font with such pointer was
added, the function returns @relativeref{Corrade,Containers::NullOpt}. Then,
for a particular font ID a font-specific glyph ID can be queried with
@ref glyphId(). If no such glyph was added yet, the function returns
@cpp 0 @ce, i.e. the invalid glyph. The @ref glyph() function then directly
returns data for given glyph, or the invalid glyph data in case the glyph
wasn't found.

@snippet Text.cpp AbstractGlyphCache-querying

As text rendering is potentially happening very often, batch
@ref glyphIdsInto(), @ref glyphOffsets(), @ref glyphLayers() and
@ref glyphRectangles() APIs are provided as well to trim down the amount of
function calls and redundant lookups:

@snippet Text.cpp AbstractGlyphCache-querying-batch

For invalid glyphs it's the caller choice to either use the invalid glyph
as-is (as done above), leading to blank spaces in the text, or remember the
font-specific glyph IDs that resolved to @cpp 0 @ce with @ref glyphId(),
rasterize them to the cache in the next round, and then update the rendered
text again.

@section Text-AbstractGlyphCache-padding Glyph padding

Fonts commonly shape the glyphs to sub-pixel positions, the GPU rasterizer then
rounds the actual quads to nearest pixels, which then can lead to neighboring
pixels to leak into the rendered glyph or, conversely, the rendered glyph
having an edge cut. Because of that, by default the glyphs are padded with one
pixel on each side, which should prevent such artifacts even if rendering the
glyphs 2x supersampled.

If you have a pixel-perfect font that gets always shaped to whole pixel
positions, you can set it back to zero in the constructor. Or for example if
you can ensure that at least lines get placed on whole pixel positions and the
line advance is whole pixels as well, you can se it to zero in one dimension at
least, assuming neither @ref TextureTools::AtlasLandfillFlag::RotatePortrait
nor @relativeref{TextureTools::AtlasLandfillFlag,RotateLandscape} is enabled in
@ref atlas().

On the other hand, if you're rendering more than 2x supersampled or for example
using the cache for generating a distance field, you may want to increase the
padding even further.

@section Text-AbstractGlyphCache-subclassing Subclassing

A subclass needs to implement the @ref doFeatures() and @ref doSetImage()
functions. If the subclass does additional processing of the glyph cache image,
it should advertise that with @ref GlyphCacheFeature::ImageProcessing and
implement @ref doSetProcessedImage() as well. If it's desirable and possible to
download the processed image as well, it should  advertise
@ref GlyphCacheFeature::ProcessedImageDownload and implement
@ref doProcessedImage().

The public @ref flushImage() function already does checking for rectangle
bounds so it's not needed to do it again inside @ref doSetImage(), similarly
the bounds checking is done for @ref doSetProcessedImage().
