<h1>(Mounted) Directories</h1><p>Some features in the app allow interaction with your device's file system. For example, you can configure your shortcuts to store the response into a file (via the "Response Handling" screen). For this, the app needs write access to a directory, which is where the "(Mounted) Directories" screen comes in. Here, you can <em>mount</em> a directory, i.e., create a connection to a specific existing directory on your device and granting the app the permission to read and write files in it.<p>You can revoke access by deleting the directory from this screen. This will not affect the real directory or its contents, only the connection to it.<p>Mounted directories can be used for the following:<ul><li>Store the response of an HTTP request into a file. This can be configured on the "Response Handling" screen when editing a shortcut.<li><a href=scripting.md#read-write-files>Read and write files</a> using the Scripting feature.</ul>
